## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana add more in-depth filters to her webpage in order to allow users to filter out multiple criterias at the same time. In addition to the date, we've added more table filters, such as: city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

Here is the Index page. When users enter Dana's website, this is the first thing they will see.

As we scroll down a little more, we are able to see the Filter Search. We have five search criterias: 
 *  Date
 *  City
 *  State
 *  Country
 *  Shape

The user is able to search multiple criterias at once, or individually. The user is able to change their search criteria as many times as they'd like as the change is detected and will update accordingly. For example, we can search the state: 'ca' individually, giving us tens of results (Image 1). Adding a second filter shape: 'triangle', bring us down to less than 10 results (Image 2). By adding a third filter date: 1/2/2010, we were able to narrow down our search result to 1 (Image 3).

Additionally, by clicking the "UFO Sightings" on the top left of the Index page, we are able to refresh, or reinitialize our search criteria instead of manually deleting each filter.

## Summary

### Drawbacks
A drawback from this webpage would be difficulties the user would face when inputting filters. The filters are case sensitive, so if we were to put in "CA" or "California" instead of "ca' for our state, we would not have any results show up. Although this wouldnt be a huge issue, it may be a tad irritating when having to reinput the filters to match the correct style. 

### Recommendations
*   A recommendation for further development is to add a drop down menu under each filter so the user obtains the ability to choose from a list rather than having to manually enter a filter, as they may not know where to start searching for first.
*   Furthermore, adding a 'clear all' button next to "Filter Search" or at the bottom, near the last criteria, can help users clear the existing filters all at once instead of maunually having to remove filter, or scrolling up to refresh the page.
